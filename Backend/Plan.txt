  - Uses WebSockets for live updates.
  - Uses Redis pub/sub for scaling and coordination.
  - Applies rate limiting and clean API design.
- Stack: Node.js, Express, WebSockets, Redis, basic API design.

Month 4 – First AI Agent: Email Assistant
- Project: Email assistant backend that:
  - Receives email text via API.
  - Uses LLM (OpenAI) to summarize, classify, or draft replies.
  - Uses LangChain.js for prompts and function calling.
- Stack: Node.js, Express, OpenAI API, LangChain.js.

Month 5 – RAG Notes Service with Vector Memory
- Project: Notes service that:
  - Stores user notes.
  - Builds embeddings and stores them in a vector DB.
  - Implements RAG: retrieve notes and answer questions.
- Stack: Node.js, Express, Postgres, vector DB (e.g., pgvector / external), LLM embeddings.

Month 6 – Multi-Agent Support Chat Backend
- Project: Support chat backend that:
  - Uses WebSockets for chat.
  - Routes messages across multiple specialist agents (FAQ, escalation, summarizer).
  - Coordinates agents via a simple state machine or LangGraph.
- Stack: Node.js, WebSockets, Redis, LangGraph or similar.

Month 7 – Observability & AI SRE Copilot
- Project: Observability layer that:
  - Collects structured logs and basic metrics.
  - Exposes an API to query logs.
  - Uses an LLM to analyze logs and suggest causes/remedies (AI SRE copilot).
- Stack: Node.js, logging/metrics library, LLM API, dashboards.

Month 8 – CI/CD, Docker, Kubernetes & Scaling
- Project: Deploy previous services:
  - Containerized with multi-stage Dockerfiles.
  - Automated tests + GitHub Actions CI/CD.
  - Deployed to Kubernetes or PaaS with health checks and autoscaling.
- Stack: Docker, GitHub Actions, Kubernetes (or managed PaaS).

Month 9 – Security, OAuth2 & Protection Layer
- Project: Security gateway that:
  - Uses OAuth2/OIDC for user auth.
  - Enforces RBAC for protected routes.
  - Applies rate limiting, input validation, and basic WAF-style checks.
- Stack: Node.js, OAuth2/OIDC provider, Express middleware, Redis.

Month 10 – Data Pipelines & Event-Driven Agents
- Project: Data pipeline for:
  - Ingesting events (user actions, logs, etc.).
  - Running ETL/ELT into a warehouse.
  - Triggering agents in response to events (event-driven agents).
- Stack: Node.js, message broker (Kafka/Redis streams), ETL scripts, optional Python integration.

Month 11 – RL-Inspired Decision Service
- Project: Decision service that:
  - Routes traffic between variants (bandits/MAB).
  - Logs outcomes and uses RL-style ideas to improve.
  - Integrates with agents for better choices (e.g., which agent/tool to call).
- Stack: Node.js, simple bandit algorithms, logging/metrics, offline analysis.

Month 12 – Capstone AI Productivity Platform
- Project: Multi-tenant SaaS platform that:
  - Combines: auth, RAG, agents, observability, security, deployment.
  - Provides a unified “productivity assistant” (tasks, notes, email, decisions).
  - Has RBAC, billing-ready structure, and documented architecture.
- Stack: Everything above, integrated.
