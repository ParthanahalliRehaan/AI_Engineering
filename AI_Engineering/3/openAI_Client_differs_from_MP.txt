Definitions:

    Model Provider:
    - The company or service that hosts and serves AI models.
    - Example: OpenAI, Anthropic, Microsoft Azure.

    Client:
    - The library, SDK, or wrapper used to send requests to the provider’s API.
    - Example: `openai` Python package, Node.js client.
    - Acts as the interface between your code and the provider.

    Model:
    - The actual AI system that generates responses.
    - Example: `gpt-4`, `gpt-4.1`, `dall-e-3`.

Distinction:
- Provider = Who owns/hosts the models.
- Client = How you connect to them.
- Model = The intelligence you’re actually using.

Quick Example (Python):

    from openai import OpenAI

    client = OpenAI()  # This is the client
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4.1",  # This is the model
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, world!"}]
    )

    print(response.choices[0].message.content)

    Explanation:
    - `OpenAI()` → the client, handling authentication and requests.
    - `"gpt-4.1"` → the model, provided by OpenAI.
    - OpenAI itself → the provider, hosting the model.
