# Model Context Protocol (MCP) – Brief Intro

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an **open standard** that allows AI applications 
to connect seamlessly with external systems like databases, APIs, and tools.

## Key Points
- **Purpose**: Standardized way to integrate AI agents with external data & workflows.
- **Analogy**: Think of MCP as a "USB-C port" for AI — one protocol unlocks many integrations.
- **Capabilities**:
  - Connect AI models to tools (e.g., search engines, calculators).
  - Access data sources (e.g., local files, cloud databases).
  - Enable workflows (e.g., calendars, project management apps).
- **Benefits**:
  - Reduces fragmented custom integrations.
  - Scales AI systems with reusable, secure connections.
  - Supports ecosystem growth with MCP servers & SDKs.

## Example Use Cases
- AI assistant accessing Google Calendar & Notion.
- Enterprise chatbot querying multiple databases.
- AI code generator building apps directly from design files.
