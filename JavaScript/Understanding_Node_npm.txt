We run node index.js ie node.js so that we can run the js in our own pc not in an browser.
So Node.js is an runtime environment which we have installed inside our pc to give powers to JS.

In cli just run " node file_name.js " to get ouput instead of browser.

npm is an installer that comes along node.js 
npm - node package manager

Role of npm
- Package installation: It lets you install libraries, frameworks, and tools (like React, Express, Lodash).
- Dependency management: It tracks and manages versions of packages your project depends on.
- Scripts: You can define custom scripts (like npm run build or npm test) to automate tasks.
- Registry access: It connects to the npm registry, which hosts millions of open-source packages.
