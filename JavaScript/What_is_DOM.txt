Why document isn’t defined in Node.js
- In a browser environment, document is part of the DOM API. It represents the HTML document loaded in the window, and you can manipulate it with methods like document.querySelector() or document.createElement().
- In Node.js, there is no DOM by default. Node is designed for server-side JavaScript, so it doesn’t provide document, window, or other browser-specific globals. That’s why if you try to access document in Node, you’ll get a ReferenceError.
